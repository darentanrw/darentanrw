## Introduction

Hello there, I'm Daren, welcome to my first ever blog. Decided to make this as a way to document all of my random side projects, thoughts and pictures! 

It feels weird to say that this is a blog, or that I am a blogger, because in the world of short-form content, blogs just seem so rare these days? Yet, I still think that it is the best medium to document and write down one's thinking process, so here we are!

## Making Writing Easy

Previously I've made websites before, but I've always gotten lazy to update it after a while. After the initial deployment, I would get lazy to update the site with new posts and pages and hence the website would stay stagnant.

Hence, the principle considerations when creating this site was to have something that:
1. Is easy to deploy, maintain, and create new posts
2. Has good performance and functionality
3. Has strong open source community support

## Inspiration

This website is heavily inspired by other portfolio websites. In particular, I really love [Joshua Bird's website](https://joshuabird.com). I first came across his YouTube video on a 3D Printed Film Video Camera - and I really love [his process of documenting](https://joshuabird.com/blog/post/3d-printed-film-video-camera) the process behind designing, troubleshooting and creating something cool from scratch! That is what I hope to achieve with this blog, to be able to show a behind the scenes and my thought process my projects.

Another website that I think look great is [Ajay Shanker's website](https://ajayshanker.netlify.app/). I think his websit has one of the best UIs and project showcases. As I get more familiar with Jekyll, I hope that I would be able to do something similar to have an overall showcase of all projects, instead of it just being in the form of blog posts on the [projects page](/projects).

## Which web framework?

Before settling on Jekyll, I had considered two other frameworks - [Hexo](https://gohugo.io), as well as [Hugo](https://hexo.io/). Both are widely used and they are very fast static site generators, but I could not find an existing theme that had the feature set I was looking for which had strong community support as well.

Hence, I eventually decided on building this website using the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It took me a day to get to know the basics, customise and deploy, and I think it looks great! As I get more familiar with Jekyll, I want to customize this site more, and maybe one day I'll create a template from scratch. I truly love open source projects, there are so many amazing things that people have created, for anyone else to use, adapt, and make their own!

Using a static site generator makes things very easy to post new content. Since all posts are Markdown files, I've further integrated this with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (my notetaking app of choice), so I don't even have to open VSCode to make a new post.

Deploying the site using Github Page on a custom domain was easy as well! With Github Actions, now each time a new commit is made, a custom Workflow runs to test and deploy the website in minutes. Having previously developed on AWS ElasticBeanStalk, this felt quite similar, but what surprised me most is the speed at which the changes propagate!

## So... what now?

Now that I have a blog, I guess all that there is to do is to continue to learn, create, and document! I will be retroactively putting up projects that I have done in the past few years, so as to just document what I have done and learnt!

Thank you for taking the time to read! I hope you'll enjoying reading these posts and find something cool in the process.
